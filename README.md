#Iris Flower Prediction
This project aims to predict the category of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris flower dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and is often used for classification tasks.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is a multivariate dataset introduced by the statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset contains a total of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each species.

#Dependencies
To run this project, the following dependencies are required:

Python 3.7
